# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm [Your Name]!  

I'm a second-year Computer Science student at **EÃ¶tvÃ¶s LorÃ¡nd TudomÃ¡nyegyetem (ELTE)** in Hungary, with a passion for creating innovative solutions and continuously expanding my knowledge in software development.  

## ðŸŒŸ Skills & Experience  

I've gained experience with a variety of programming languages, tools, and frameworks, including:  
- **Programming Languages**: JavaScript, PHP, C++, C, Java, C#, Python, and (Haskell).

- **Frameworks and Libraries**: Working with responsive design tools and modern UI frameworks.  

## ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Working On  

Iâ€™m currently focused on my studies and school projects, which keep me busy most of the time. Beyond academics, I have a strong interest in **computer graphics** (using OpenGL with C++), where I enjoy exploring the visual side of programming.  

I also have a deep passion for working with **C#**, particularly in developing desktop applications. Looking ahead, Iâ€™m excited to expand my skills by learning **ASP.NET** with the **MVC pattern**, diving into web application development.  

## ðŸ“š Interests  

- Developing dynamic and responsive applications.  
- Exploring software architecture and design patterns.  
- Learning about new technologies and how they shape the future of software engineering.  

## ðŸ’¡ Fun Fact
